Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher Browy. I'm a 4th year student at the University of Florida pursuing a B.S. in Statistics and B.A. in Economics.

I'm experienced using R as a TA and an RA, but I hope to get more experience in Python and SQL, too. 

You can reach me at chrisbrowy@outlook.com or cbrowy@ufl.edu.
